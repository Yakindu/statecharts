h1(#inst_installing_yakindu_statechart_tools). Installing YAKINDU Statechart Tools

In order to start working with YAKINDU Statechart Tools, you have to install the software on your computer. We are assuming you have downloaded the software package and stored it somewhere on your machine.

The installation process boils down to
# checking the "system requirements":#inst_system-requirements,
# unpacking the downloaded ZIP file containing YAKINDU Statechart Tools, and
# executing the _SCT_ application.

This is explained in more detail in section "&quot;Platform overview&quot;":#inst_platform-overview and the following sections.

Java developers might want to read section "JRE not found":#inst_jre-not-found, in case they encounter a certain problem.



h2(#inst_system-requirements). System requirements

h3(#inst_java). Java

YAKINDU Statechart Tools is based on the Java programming language and requires *Java 8* or higher. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed on your computer.

Installation of Java is beyond the scope of this document. You can find more information on Java and download it for free from Oracle Corporation at "https://www.java.com/":https://www.java.com/. Before downloading Java, make sure you are picking the variant with the correct bit size, i.&nbsp;e. either 32 or 64 bit, whichever is appropriate for your computer.


h3(#inst_eclipse). Eclipse

Internally, YAKINDU Statechart Tools are based on *"Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/*, an integrated development environment (IDE). YAKINDU Statechart Tools are running inside the Eclipse environment. When you are installing YAKINDU Statechart Tools, a full-fledged Eclipse instance will be put on your computer. Currently it is the *Oxygen* release.

###. CHECK: Is Oxygen still the current Eclipse release?

If you are new to Eclipse, you might find the "Eclipse Help":http://help.eclipse.org/ useful, especially the "Workbench User Guide".

If you are an experienced Eclipse user, you can install YAKINDU Statechart Tools into a existing Eclipse instance from an update site.

h2(#inst_installing_on_linux). Installing on Linux

This chapter describes how to install YAKINDU Statechart Tools on a Linux machine using a command-line tool.


h3(#inst_installing_on_linux_installing_required_packages). Installing required packages

Depending on your Linux distribution and version, you might need to install additional packages for *Webkit GTK* and *Java* from your distribution's repository (or elsewhere). Below please find the necessary commands for some Linux distributions. To execute them, you have to have system administrator permissions. So please create a _root_ command-line shell or use the _sudo_ command, which is the typical procedure on Linux.

The list of Linux distributions mentioned below is in no way meant to be exhaustive. If your Linux distribution is not yet among them and you manage to find out the proper commands for it, please let us know!

On Linux, Eclipse uses the GTK library for drawing the user interface. Some users experience issues, especially when using the default version GTK3. If your installation of YAKINDU Statechart Tools does not perform as expected, is laggy, has drawing issues or looks weird, refer to "Configuring YAKINDU Statechart Tools to use GTK2":#inst_linux_gtk2. If the welcome page looks broken and asks you to configure _webkitgtk_, refer to "Webkit GTK":#inst_installing_on_linux_webkit_gtk.


h4(#inst_linux_gtk2). Configuring YAKINDU Statechart Tools to use GTK2

_GTK+_ is one of two major graphics libraries used in the Linux world (the other one being _Qt_), and it is the one being used by the Eclipse project, on which YAKINDU Statechart Tools are based. There are two different versions of GTK+: The newest one is often referred to as "GTK3", and the old one is named "GTK2" or just "GTK".

Eclipse made the switch from GTK2 to GTK3 with the Mars release. While in general it looks and performs somewhat better, some users experience issues with it, especially concerning the performance or just drawing bugs, like wrong colors being used or widgets not displaying properly. If you experience anything like that, you should try to configure YAKINDU Statechart Tools to use GTK2, which is fairly easy to do.

h5. Giving GTK2 a try

You can use GTK2 instead of GTK3 on a case-by-case basis by having the environment variable or shell variable _SWT_GTK3_ set as shown below when starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools. On the command line, you would usually start the stand-alone YAKINDU Statechart Tools like this:

bc. ./SCT

This assumes your current directory is the tool's installation folder. Please also see section "&quot;Starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools&quot;":#inst_installing_on_linux_starting_yakindu_statechart_tools.

To use GTK2, execute this command instead:

bc. SWT_GTK3=0 ./SCT

It defines the _SWT_GTK3_ shell variable _SWT_GTK3_ with a value of 0 and passes it to the _SCT_ process.

If you installed YAKINDU Statechart Tools into another Eclipse instance, the corresponding command to start that Eclipse instance is:

bc. SWT_GTK3=0 ./eclipse

h5. Permanently changing to GTK2

If you want to make your switch to GTK2 permanent without having to set the _SWT_GTK3_ variable each time, you can define that in the tool's _.ini_ file. In a stand-alone YAKINDU Statechart Tools installation, that's the file _SCT.ini_ in the _yakindu-sct_ installation folder. If you installed YAKINDU Statechart Tools into an existing Eclipse installation instead, it's the file _eclipse.ini_ in that Eclipse instance's installation directory.

Navigate to the _yakindu-sct_ installation folder of your YAKINDU Statechart Tools instance or to the _eclipse_ installation folder of your Eclipse instance, and open the file _SCT.ini_ or _eclipse.ini_, respectively, with a plain-text editor of your choice.

Look for the "-vmargs" line. Right _above_ this line, paste these two new lines:

bc. 
--launcher.GTK_version
2

The result looks similar to this:

bc. 
-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.4.0.v20161219-1356.jar
--launcher.library
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.linux.x86_64_1.1.550.v20170928-1359
--launcher.GTK_version
2
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8
-Xms256m
-server
-XX:PermSize=256m
-XX:+UseParallelGC
-Xmx3G
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m

bq. *Please note*: Do _not_ attempt to replace all of the contents of your _SCT.ini_ file with the lines above! The specified version numbers have to match your installation, and if you change them, SCT will not be able to start anymore.

In order to double-check that YAKINDU Statechart Tools now uses GTK2, please proceed as follows:
* Start YAKINDU Statechart Tools.
* Navigate to _Help → About YAKINDU SCT → Installation Details → Configuration_. You will get a bunch of text containing all kinds of internal variables.
* Somewhat down the lines, you will find the _org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.version_ entry. Its major version number should now be 2 instead of 3, for example 2.24.30.


h4(#inst_installing_on_linux_webkit_gtk). Webkit GTK

On Linux, you might encounter certain user interface problems or display irregularities when working with Eclipse-based software, e.g., when viewing the welcome page. This is a general problem that can also affect YAKINDU Statechart Tools. It is due to Eclipse on Linux needing specific versions of the _libwebkitgtk_ library to function properly. Depending on your Linux distribution and version, you already have a suitable _libwebkitgtk_ library installed or not.

Commands for installing proper _libwebkitgtk_ versions:


*Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS:*

bc. 
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0.0
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-3.0.0


*Fedora 25 Workstation:*

bc. yum install webkitgtk


*openSUSE Leap 42.2:*

_Works out of the box; nothing to be done._


*Red Hat Workstation 7.3:*

# Download the RPM file _webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm_ from, e.g., "http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/31819125/dir/redhat_el_7/com/webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm.html":http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/31819125/dir/redhat_el_7/com/webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm.html.

h3(#inst_installing_on_linux_unpacking-the-downloaded-file). Unpacking the downloaded file

Choose a directory for YAKINDU Statechart Tools. The commands below assume you want to install the software in the _/my/software_ directory. Please modify the commands appropriately to install somewhere else!

Go to the installation directory:

bc. cd /my/software/

Unpack the software distribution file. If the downloaded file is located in _/download/sct-linux.gtk.x86&#95;64.zip_, use the following command to unpack in the installation directory:

bc. unzip /download/sct-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip

This will create a folder _yakindu-sct_ in your installation directory, i.e., _/my/software/yakindu-sct_ in our example, as shown in the image below:

p=. The _Install_ wizard

Click on the _Add..._ button near the upper right corner of the wizard.

A dialog opens, asking you to specify the update repository you want to install the new software from. The appropriate update repository depends on your Eclipse version. Please enter the URL of the respective update repository into the _Location_ field.

bq. *Please note:* Update site URLs are available online via the "YAKINDU Statechart Tools download page":https://info.itemis.com/state-machine/download-yakindu-statechart-tools.

Enter some text into the _Name_ field. This text is abitrary in principle, but you should choose something that makes it easier for you to identify this particular update repository among other update repositories. In the example below, the repository's name is @YAKINDU Statechart Tools (Luna)@. It describes which piece of software the repository provides (YAKINDU Statechart Tools) and which Eclipse release that software is compatible with (Luna, i.e., Eclipse 4.4).

!images/inst_eclipse_030_eclipse_add_repository.png(Adding a software repository)!

p=. Adding a software repository

After entering name and location of the update repository, click _OK_.

h2(#inst_installing_a_yakindu_statechart_tools_license). Installing a YAKINDU Statechart Tools license

YAKINDU Statechart Tools Professional and Standard Edition come with an evaluation license that is valid for 30 days. If you want to continue working with YAKINDU Statechart Tools Professional or Standard Edition beyond that period of time you have to "*acquire a license*":https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/licences/.

We offer academic licenses for the Professional Edition and non-commercial licenses for the Standard Edition which are both free of charge, but both require a license file, valid for one year. If you think you meet the requirements for these licenses, you can apply for them "*on our website*":https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/licences/.

The license manager documentation describes how you can install a license file or configure a license server for floating licenses. To access that documentation, select Help → Help Contents from YAKINDU Statechart Tools’ main menu, then open the YAKINDU License Management documentation. 



h2(#inst_jre-not-found). JRE not found

If you want to develop Java source code, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) in your workspace.

Usually Eclipse's Java Development Toolkit (JDT), which is bundled with YAKINDU Statechart Tools, automatically finds one or more JREs on your machine. However, under certain circumstances this won't work and even the JRE that is used to run Eclipse cannot be found. In this case, you will have to add a JRE definition to your workspace by hand.

In order to check whether you are affected, proceed as follows:

# In the main menu, select _Window → Preferences_. The _Preferences_ window opens.
# In the _Preferences_ window, select _Java → Installed JREs_.

If the list of installed JREs is empty, you are affected by the problem and will have to manually add a JRE definition. Click on the _Add…_ button and follow the _Add JRE_ wizard. The Eclipse documentation explains in more detail how to "add a new JRE definition":http://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-add_new_jre.htm to your workspace.

###. CHECK Does the link http://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-add_new_jre.htm still point to how to add a JRE?
