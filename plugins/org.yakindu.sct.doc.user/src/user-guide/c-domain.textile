h1(#cdom_deep_c_integration). Deep C/C++ Integration

The YAKINDU Statechart Tools Professional Edition comes with a _Deep C/C++ Integration_ feature, which allows for using C/C++ types, variables, and operations directly within the statechart model. C/C++ header files located in your workspace are automatically recognized by the tool, and all contained type and operation declarations are made accessible in the statechart editor with all its editing features like code completion and validation. In addition to your custom C/C++ types, the C99 standard primitive types, like _int16_t_, are also available out of the box. 

Making your self-defined C/C++ types, structs, and unions available in your YAKINDU statecharts saves you a lot of time and hassle that would otherwise be needed to map data from your C-type variables to statechart variables and vice versa.

The C/C++ domain offers one more feature: The @ShortCIdentifiers@ annotation changes the naming scheme used by the code generator and activates more checks in the statechart validation to ensure that no identifiers produced by the code generator are longer than 31 characters. 




h2(#cdom_what_can_you_do_with_deep_ccpp_integration). What can you do with Deep C/C++ Integration?

Deep C/C++ Integration allows you to use constructs declared in C/C++ header files seamlessly in your statecharts. For C, this includes:

* Functions, including variadic parameters
* Structs, unions and enums contained in a typedef
** Function pointers contained in a struct can be called it right from your statechart.
* Values introduced by the @#define@ statement, e.g., @#define ARRAYSIZE 20@
* Variables
* Arrays, provided they are allocated in the header file
* Pointers

The following C++ features are supported:

* Classes, including their fields and functions
* Namespaces
* Template classes and functions
* Functions with optional parameters

C/C++ features that are currently unsupported:

* Structs, unions and enums that are _not_ contained in a typedef
* Accessing or modifying function pointer values in structs
* Constructors and initializers
* Memory allocation

h2(#cdom_how_to_use_deep_ccpp_integration). How to use Deep C/C++ Integration

Using Deep C/C++ Integration is pretty straightforward:

# Your YAKINDU Statechart Tools license must include the C/C++ domain.
# You have to use a "C/C++ domain" statechart or change the domain of an existing statechart.
# The Eclipse project your statechart is in must be a "CDT project":https://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fcdt_c_projects.htm.

The subsequent sections will explain how to use Deep C/C++ Integration in practice, using a sample project. In this example, we will define some geometry types like _Point_ or _Triangle_ in C/C++ header files and demonstrate how to make them available and use them in a statechart model. While this example covers C constructs only, there is no extra effort involved in using C++ features – with one exception: Your project must be a C/C++ or a pure C++ project.

# In the Eclipse main menu, select _File → New → Project…_. The _New Project_ wizard opens.

# Click _Finish_.
# Eclipse asks whether it should associate this kind of project with the C/C++ perspective. Usually this is what you want, so set a checkmark at _Remember my decision_ and click _Yes_.
# Eclipse creates the C project, here *Geometry*.




h3(#cdom_creating_a_c_header_file). Creating a C header file

Now we can create a C header file specifying our own C type definitions which we can use in a state machine later. In order to create the file, let's proceed as follows:

# In the project explorer view, right-click on the project. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _New → Header File_.<br/>!images/cdom_geometry_020_new_header_file_010.png(Creating a C header file)!
# The dialog _New Header File_ is shown. Specify the name of the header file. Here we choose *point.h*.<br/>!images/cdom_geometry_020_new_header_file_020.png(Selecting a header filename)!
# Click _Finish_. 
# The header file _point.h_ is created.<br/>




h3(#cdom_defining_a_c_struct). Defining a C struct

In the created header file we define a struct type named _Point_, which we will later use in a statechart. A (two-dimensional) point consists of an _x_ and a _y_ coordinate. We choose _int16_t_ to represent a coordinate, i.e., a 16-bit signed integer. The complete header file containing the struct definition looks like this:

bc.. 
/*
 * point.h
 *
 */

#ifndef POINT_H_
#define POINT_H_

#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct {
    int16_t x;
    int16_t y;
} Point;

#endif /* POINT_H_ */

bq.. *Please note:* In C it is possible to define structs, unions and enums without a _typedef_. They can be referenced by using the corresponding qualifying keyword (_struct_, _union_, or _enum_, respectively). As the statechart language does *not* support these qualifiers, the usage of struct, union and enumeration types is currently restricted to those defined by a _typedef_.




h2(#cdom_using_c_types_in_a_statechart). Using C types in a statechart

h3(#cdom_creating_a_statechart_model). Creating a statechart model

Let's create a statechart model now to make use of the C type _Point_ we have just defined.

# Right-click on the project. The context menu opens.
# Select _New → C Statechart Model …_. The _New YAKINDU Statechart_ wizard is shown.
# In the dialog, specify the directory and the filename for the new statechart model file. The filename should end with @.sct@.
# Click _Finish_. If Eclipse asks you whether to switch to the _YAKINDU Modeling_ perspective, please confirm.
# The new statechart model is created:<br/>!images/cdom_geometry_030_new_statechart_model_030.png(New statechart model)!



h3(#cdom_defining_a_c-type_variable_in_a_statechart). Defining a C-type variable in a statechart

Variables are defined in the definition section on the left-hand side of the statechart editor. Double-click into the definition section to edit it.

In order to make use of the struct defined above we have to import the _point.h_ header file:

bc. 
import: "point.h"

With the definitions from _point.h_ at hand, we can declare a variable _pointA_ of the _Point_ type. In the statechart's definition section, enter the following text:

bc. 
interface:
    var pointA:

On the right-hand side of the colon in the variable declaration, the variable's type must follow. In order to see which types are available, press @[Ctrl+Space]@. The content assist opens and shows the C types available, depending on the headers imported within your statechart, i.e.
* the C basic standard types,
* the C99 types, provided by including _stdint.h_,
* the self-defined _Point_ type, provided by including _point.h_,
* the qualifier _pointer_.

!images/cdom_geometry_040_c_types_010.png(Using content assist to display available types)!

p=. Using content assist to display available types

Selecting the _Point_ menu entry completes the variable definition:

!images/cdom_geometry_040_c_types_020.png(A "Point" variable)!

p=. A _Point_ variable



h3(#cdom_using_a_c-type_variable_in_a_statechart). Using a C-type variable in a statechart

A statechart variable with a C type can be used everywhere a "normal" statechart variable can be used.

Let's consider the above example extended by an additional _count_ variable of the C99 _int8_t_ standard type. Additionally, we introduce an event that will be used as a trigger to switch between states.

bc. import: "point.h"
interface:
    var count: int8_t
    var pointA: Point
    in event tick

The statechart below uses these variables in various places, i.e., in transition actions, in internal actions, and in guard conditions.

!images/cdom_geometry_050_using_c_type_variables_010.png(Using C-type variables)!

p=. Using C-type variables

Variables of primitive types like @var count: int8_t@ are accessed as expected, e.g., @count = 0@ or @count += 1;@

The dot notation is used to access structure elements. For example, @pointA.x = 0; pointA.y = 0@ sets _pointA_ to the origin of the coordinate system.



h3(#cdom_the_statechart_type_system). The statechart type system

When parsing a C header file, YAKINDU Statechart Tools are mapping the C data types to an internal type system. You can open a C header file in Eclipse with the _Sample Reflective Ecore Model Editor_ to see how the mapping result looks like.

In case you are interested in the EMF model underlying YAKINDU Statechart Tools' type system, you can find it in the source code of the YAKINDU Statechart Tools open edition at _/org.yakindu.base.types/model/types.ecore_.




h2(#cdom_imports_and_includes). Imports and includes

h3(#cdom_importing_a_c_header). Importing a C header

YAKINDU Statechart Tools gives you direct access to C header files within the statechart model. This saves time during development, especially while integrating your state machine with your C program. In general you can import (include) all C header files residing in the same project as well as those header files that are available on one of the CDT project's include paths, see _Properties → C/C++ General → Paths and Symbols_ in the context menu of your C project. Valid file extensions for C/C++ header files: ".h", ".hh", "hpp", "hxx" and ".inc".

To import a C header file, go to the beginning of your statechart's definition section, enter @import:@ and hit <code>[Ctrl]+[Space]</code>. The content assist now shows all C header files you can import (besides other syntactical elements that would be valid here). In our example one of the first includes provided by the content assist is _point.h_, which is found in _/Geometry/point.h_. Other imports shown by the content assist are provided by the various include paths configured in your CDT project. For example, figure "&quot;Selecting a C header to import&quot;":#cdom_fig_selecting_a_c_header_to_import shows headers on the basic _cygwin_ toolchain on a Windows system.

bq.. *Please note:* Contrary to a C compiler, YAKINDU Statechart Tools do not support transitive imports. That is to say, if a header file _a.h_ imports another header file _b.h_ using the @#include@ directive, _b.h_ will not be "seen" in YAKINDU Statechart Tools unless you import it explicitly in your statechart's definition section.

p(#cdom_fig_selecting_a_c_header_to_import). 

The following picture for example .

!images/cdom_geometry_060_importing_namespace_010.png(Selecting a namespace to import)!

p=. Selecting a C header to import

If we had more than a single header file in the project, we would see them all. The content assist shows all header files in a project, including those in subdirectories. A C header's path is relative to the statechart it is imported into.

Click on the _point.h_ entry in the menu to complete the @import@ statement. The result looks like this:

bc.. import: "point.h"

interface:
    var pointA: Point
p. 



h2(#cdom_data_structure_traversal_via_dot_notation). Data structure traversal via dot notation

The dot notation to access structure members can traverse an arbitrary number of stages. As an example, let's define a datatype named _Triangle_. A triangle is defined by three points. Using dot notation in a statechart, you can navigate from a triangle to its individual points and further on to the points' coordinates.

The C header file _triangle.h_ specifies the _Triangle_ type:

bc.. #ifndef TRIANGLE_H_
#define TRIANGLE_H_

#include "./point.h"

typedef struct {
    Point a, b, c;
} Triangle;

#endif /* TRIANGLE_H_ */
p. A _Triangle_ consists of the three _Points_ _a_, _b_, and _c_. Let's define a _Triangle_ _t_ in a statechart's definition section as follows:

bc.. import: "triangle.h"

interface:
    var t: Triangle
p. With this definition we can use expressions like @t.a.x@, see the image below. Regardless of where you are currently editing an expression, you can always use the code assist to explore which fields are available at that very point and of which types these fields are. Example:

!images/cdom_geometry_170_data_structure_traversal_010.png(Content assist in data structure traversal)!

p=. Content assist in data structure traversal




h2(#cdom_pointers). Pointers

Pointers are a core feature of the C programming language. YAKINDU Statechart Tools' Deep C/C++ Integration is making C pointers available to you in your statecharts. In particular, you can
* declare typed pointer variables,
* assign a pointer to a pointer variable of the same type,
* retrieve the pointer pointing to a given variable,
* pass pointers as parameters to functions, and
* receive a pointer as a functions return value.



h3(#cdom_declaring_pointer_variables). Declaring pointer variables

Pointer variables are declared in a statechart's definition section as shown in the following example:

bc. var n: int32_t
var pInt: pointer<int32_t>
var ppInt: pointer<pointer<int32_t> >
var pTriangle: pointer<Triangle>;


The declarations above declare
* _n_ as a (non-pointer) variable of type _int32_t_,
* _pInt_ as a pointer variable that is pointing to a variable of type _int32_t_,
* _ppInt_ as a pointer that is pointing to a pointer that is pointing to a variable of type _int32_t_, and
* _pTriangle_ as a pointer to a variable of the self-defined type _Triangle_.

bq.. *Please note:* When closing the type specification in a pointer declaration with angle brackets, e.g., @pointer<pointer<int32_t> >@, the @>@ characters must be separated from each other by one or more white space characters. Writing, for example, @pointer<pointer<int32_t>>@ would result in an error. This restriction will be fixed in a later release.



h3(#cdom_using_pointer_variables). Using pointer variables

In order to actually assign a pointer to a pointer variable, you have to get hold of that pointer. To retrieve the pointer to a variable _v_, use _v_'s extension function _pointer_. That is, for a variable _v_, the expression _v.pointer_ evaluates to a pointer to _v_. Each variable has the _pointer_ extension function.

Example: Let's say the pointer variable _pInt_ (declared in the example above) should point to the variable _n_. The following assignment accomplishes this:

bc. pInt = n.pointer

Similarly, a pointer to a pointer to a base type can be retrieved as follows:

bc. ppInt = pInt.pointer;

Or even:

bc. ppInt = n.pointer.pointer

In order to deference a pointer, i.&nbsp;e. to retrieve the value of what the pointer is pointing to, use the _value_ extension function, which is available on all pointer-type variables.

Example: Let's say the pointer variable _pInt_ (declared in the example above) is pointing to some _int32_t_ variable. The value of the variable _pInt_ is pointing to should be assigned to the _int32_t_ variable _n_. The following assignment accomplishes this:

bc. n = pInt.value;

Similarly, if _ppInt_ points to a pointer pointing to some _int32_t_ variable, the following statement retrieves the latter's value:

bc. n = ppInt.value.value;

Passing pointer parameters to C functions is straightforward. Let's say you have a C function to rotate a triangle around a center point by a given angle. The C function is defined like this:

bc. Triangle* rotateTriangle(Triangle* triangle, Point* centerPoint, float angle) { … }

Provided the function is declared in an imported C header file, you can call it directly like this:

bc. pTriangle2 = rotateTriangle(pTriangle, pCenterPoint, 45.0);

bq.. *Please note:* Assigning a pointer to a pointer variable is only possible if the pointer types are the same.




h2(#cdom_arrays). Arrays

Unlike other variables, arrays are not defined in a statechart's definition section, but rather on the C side in header files. Importing a C header containing an array definition makes the array available to a statechart.

While YAKINDU Statechart Tool's Deep C/C++ Integration provides mechanisms for accessing individual elements of an existent array, arrays must be allocated statically or dynamically in C. Initializing the array elements is possible in C as well as in the statechart. However, depending on the concrete application it might generally be easier in C.

The header file _sample_arrays.h_ defines a couple of sample arrays:

bc.. #ifndef SAMPLE_ARRAYS_H_
#define SAMPLE_ARRAYS_H_

#include <stdint.h>
#include "triangle.h"

int32_t coordinates[] = {0, 0, 10, 0, 5, 5};

Triangle manyTriangles[200];

int32_t * pArray[10];

#endif /* SAMPLE_ARRAYS_H_ */
p. The following arrays are defined:
* _coordinates_ is statically allocated to hold six _int32_t_ elements and it is initialized with values for all six of them. More precisely, the number of elements in the initializer determines the size of the array.
* _manyTriangles_ is statically allocated with enough memory to hold 200 elements of the self-defined _Triangle_ type. However, these elements are not initialized. This can and should be done either in C or in the state machine. An example is given below.
* _pArray_ is of size 10 and holds pointers to _int32_t_ values.

As mentioned above, importing a header file containing array definitions into the statechart's definition section is sufficient to make the arrays available in a statechart. Example:

bc. import: sample_arrays

With this import, you can access the arrays in statechart language expressions, for example in a state's local reactions:

bc. entry /
coordinates[2] = 42

Writing to array elements is as straightforward as you would expect. Examples:

bc. coordinates[0] = coordinates[0] + 1;
pArray[3] = n.pointer;
pArray[4] = coordinates[0].pointer

Passing arrays as parameters to C functions is straightforward. Let's say you have a C function _sort_ to sort the elements of a one-dimensional _int32_t_ array and return a pointer to the sorted array:

bc. int32_t* sort(int32_t data[], int size) {…}

Please note that in C a function cannot return an array as such, but only a pointer to it. Analogously you cannot pass an array by value as a parameter to a function, i.&nbsp;e. the data bytes the array is consisting of are not copied into the function's formal parameter. Instead a pointer to the array is passed to the function, or – to be more exact – a pointer to the array's first element. To express this in the function's formal parameter type, you can specify the _sort_ function equivalently to the above definition as follows. The _data_ parameter is now specified as @int32_t* data@ instead of @int32_t data[]@, but the meaning is exactly the same.

bc. int32_t* sort(int32_t* data, int size) {…}

Provided the function is declared in an imported C header file, you can call it directly like this:

bc. sort(coordinates, 6)

bq.. *Please note:* The current YAKINDU Statecharts Tools release only supports statically allocated arrays. Arrays dynamically allocated using _malloc()_ or _calloc()_ will be supported in a later version.




h2(#cdom_enums). Enums

Besides specifying structured types, it is also possible to declare enumeration types in a C header. Here's the header file _color.h_, which defines the _Color_ enumeration type:

bc.. #ifndef COLOR_H_
#define COLOR_H_

typedef enum {
    RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, BLACK, WHITE
} Color;

#endif /* COLOR_H_ */
p. Now let's extend the _Triangle_ defined above by a fill color:

bc.. #ifndef TRIANGLE_H_
#define TRIANGLE_H_

#include "./point.h"
#include "./color.h"

typedef struct {
    Point a, b, c;
    Color fillColor;

} Triangle;

#endif /* TRIANGLE_H_ */
p. Similar to the _Triangle_ type or any other C type, the _Color_ enumeration type can be used in the statechart, e.g., by declaring an additional interface variable:

bc.. import: "color.h"
import: "triangle.h"

interface:
    var t: Triangle
    var c: Color = Color.BLUE
p. Please note that unlike structured types, enumeration variables can be initialized directly in their definitions within the statechart's definition section.

In order to see which enumeration values are available, the content assist, triggered by @[Ctrl+Space]@, is helpful again.

p(#cdom_fig_ssing_content_assist_to_select_an_enumeration_value_1). 

!(small)images/cdom_geometry_083_enum_010_content_assist.png(Using content assist to select an enumeration value [1])!

p=. Using content assist to select an enumeration value &#91;1]

Once initialized, the _c_ variable can now be used, e.g., in an assignment to the triangle _t_'s fill color:

bc.  t.fillColor = c;

Accordingly, during simulation, the values of enum variables are displayed in the simulation view. It is also possible to modify them manually.

p(#cdom_fig_ssing_content_assist_to_select_an_enumeration_value_2). 

!images/cdom_geometry_083_enum_020_simulation.png(Using content assist to select an enumeration value [2])!

p=. Using content assist to select an enumeration value &#91;2]




h2(#cdom_operations). Operations

A function declared in a C header file becomes available in a statechart. The state machine can call it as an _operation_.

Let's say our _rectangle.h_ header file not only defines the data type, but also declares one or more C functions to operate on them. The following line declares a function named _area_, taking a _Rectangle_ parameter by value and returning an _int32_t_ result.

bc. extern int32_t area(Rectangle r);

For the sake of the example, let's assume the function calculates the area of the given rectangle. Of course we could also do this with means built into the statechart language. However, in the general case you neither _can_ nor _want_ to do that.
* Implementing the functionality in the statechart language might not be possible, because the latter does not provide the necessary means, e.g., to pull some data from an external source.
* Even if it would be possible to implement the functionality in the statechart language, it might still not be desirable, if the functionality has been developed and fully tested in C already. You will neither want to re-invent the wheel nor would you want to introduce any new errors into an alternative implementation.

YAKINDU Statechart Tools parses function declarations in header files and makes the functions available in the statechart language. It doesn't care where those functions are defined – or whether they are defined at all – nor what they do. Questions like these will become relevant later when the state machine is generated as C source code, compiled and linked to the functions' implementations.

For now, once the statechart knows about the _area_ function's declaration in the C header file, the function can be used immediately in statechart language operations. A corresponding @operation@ declaration in the statechart's definition section is not needed. Example:

!images/cdom_geometry_090_operations_010_content_assist.png(Using content assist to enter a C function call)!

p=. Using content assist to enter a C function call

Here's the complete example with the area calculations done by the _area_ function:

!images/cdom_geometry_090_operations_020_calling_area.png(Example calling the "area" function)!

p=. Example calling the "area" function

bq.. *Please note:* State machines calling C functions as operations are debarred from simulation and debugging. The simulator is not yet capable to call C functions.




h2(#cdom_cppclasses). C++ classes

Classes contained in C++ header files are usable from statecharts as well.

bc.. class Point
{
    public:
        int32_t get_x();
        void set_x(int32_t x);
        int32_t get_y();
        void set_y(int32_t y);
    private:
        int32_t x;
        int32_t y;
};
p. By importing a header file containing this C++ class definition, one or more variables of the _Point_ type can be defined in the statechart:

bc. import: "Point.h"
interface:
    var PointA: Point
    var PointB: Point
    out event e

As expected, it is possible to access public functions and fields of these variables. For example, _x_ and _y_ can be set and read from within a state's or a transition's reactions:

bc. entry / PointA.set_x(42); PointA.set_y(0)

bc. [PointA.get_x() == 42] / raise e




h2(#cdom_cpp_template_classes_and_functions). C++ template classes and functions

h3(#cdom_template_classes). Template classes

C++ allows to create generic constructs by defining templates. For example, if you want to be able to create _Point_ objects with integer as well as floating point coordinates, you could write:

bc.. template<typename T>
class Point
{
    public:
        T get_x();
        void set_x(T x);
        T get_y();
        void set_y(T y);
    private:
        T x;
        T y;
};
p. This definition creates a generic type in YAKINDU Statechart Tools. In the definition section, you then supply the concrete type parameter, here _int32_t_:

bc.. import: "Point.h"
interface:
    var PointA: Point<int32_t>
    var PointB: Point<int32_t>
    out event e
p. Instead of _int32_t_, _double_, _ComplexNumber_, or any other type could have been specified instead.

YAKINDU Statechart Tools verifies the usage. Thus with _int32_t_, the function call @PointA.set_x(4.2)@ would be flagged as an error.



h3(#cdom_template_functions). Template functions

C++ also allows to create template functions, which can, but don't have to, be a part of a class.

A typical example is a @max(T a, T b)@ function:

bc. template<typename T>
T max(T a, T b)
{
    return (a < b) ? b : a;
}

Template functions do not have to have their type parameter declared. YAKINDU Statechart Tools checks whether the supplied arguments are compatible. Calling @max(4, 3.5)@ would be fine, and _T_ would be inferred to be _double_, whereas _max(4, true)_ is invalid, because integer types and boolean types are not compatible.




h2(#cdom_namespaces). Namespaces

In C++, things can be organized in namespaces. Namespaces are typically applied to classes.

bc.. namespace Geo {

    class Point
    {
    public:
        double get_x();
        void set_x(double x);
        double get_y();
        void set_y(double y);
    private:
        double x;
        double y;
    };

}
p. To use the _Point_ class, one would have to write @Geo::Point@ in C++. In YAKINDU Statechart Tools, namespaces are reflected as _packages_. For each header file you import into your statechart, a package is created, plus an additional package for each namespace.

In the definition section, one would write:

bc. import: "Point.h"
interface:
    var PointA: Geo.Point
    var PointB: Geo.Point
    out event e

Namespaces can be nested, so if namespace _Geo_ would be contained in namespace _Math_, _Point_ would be addressed as @Math.Geo.Point@.




h2(#cdom_simulation). Simulation

During a statechart simulation full access to the C data structures is possible on all layers. The user can inspect them as well as modify them in the simulation view.

The state machine below exemplifies this. Initially it defines two rectangles _a_ and _b_ with certain widths and heights. The state machine calculates the rectangles' respective area size, stores their sizes in two _int32_t_ variables named _area_a_ and _area_b_, and compares them. Depending on the result, it proceeds to state *A is larger* or to *A is smaller*. Only if both _a_ and _b_ have the same area – not necessarily the same width and height –, the state machine proceeds to its final state.

When one of the states *A is larger* or *A is smaller* is active, the rectangles' properties can be changed. Triggering the _compare_size_ event transitions to the *Check* state which repeats the area size comparison as described above.

!images/cdom_geometry_080_simulation_010_statechart.png(The rectangle comparison statechart)!

p=. The rectangle comparison statechart

The state machine's definitions are as follows:

bc.. import: "rectangle.h"

interface:
    var a: Rectangle
    var b: Rectangle
    var area_a: int16_t
    var area_b: int16_t

internal:
    event compare_size

p. The _Rectangle_ datatype is defined in a new header file _rectangle.h_ with the following contents:

bc.. #include "./point.h"

typedef struct {
    Point lowerLeft;
    int16_t width, height;
} Rectangle;
p. In order to simulate the statechart, right-click on the statechart file in the project explorer and select _Run As → Statechart Simulation_ from the context menu.

The statechart simulation
* starts,
* performs the initializing actions specified in the transition from the initial state to the *Check* state,
* in the *Check* state, calculates the rectangles' areas and stores the results in the _area_a_ and _area_b_ variables,
* transitions to the *A is larger* state, because its guard condition is fulfilled, and
* stops, waiting for the _compare_size_ event to occur.

p=. Inspecting C data structures

The simulation view in the screenshot above is showing the state machine's variables and their values. Click to open or close the nested data structures. The image below shows in particular
* the rectangles' respective width and height values as have been set initially,
* the calculated areas of the _a_ and _b_ rectangles,
* the coordinates of the points defining the respective lower left corner of the rectangles.

bq.. *Warning:* Simple C variables and fields in C data structure are *not* initialized. Never try to read a variable or field you haven't written before, because it might contain arbitrary values.

Even if the _Point_ data structures in the example above look like having been initialized to defined values, they are not. Without going into details, in C, variables are generally *not* initialized. This also holds for statechart variables from the C integration. If you are reading a variable, make sure you have written to it before. Otherwise you might get surprising and non-deterministic results.

h3(#cdom_modifying_c_data_structures). Modifying C data structures

Change a variable's or field's value as follows:
# Click on the _value_ displayed in the simulation view.
# Enter the new value into the text field, see figure "&quot;Modifying C data values&quot;":#cdom_fig_modifying_c_data_values where _a.height_ is being edited and the previous value 7 is replaced by 3.
# Press the @[Enter]@ key to quit editing and to write the new value to the variable or field. Giving the input focus to another window has the same effect.
# You can cancel editing by pressing the @[Esc]@ key. The variable's or field's value remains unchanged.

In the example, click _compare_size_ to trigger the event. The state machine transitions to the *Check* state, recalculates the areas, and behaves as explained above.

p=. Rectangle areas modified and rechecked




h2(#cdom_looking_up_a_type_definition). Looking up a type definition

Given a variable definition in a statechart's definition section, you can lookup the corresponding type definition. The definition section must be in editing mode, i.e., you must have double-clicked into it. Now press the @[Ctrl]@ key and move the mouse pointer over the type name. The former changes its shape into a hand symbol and the latter changes into a hyperlink:

h2(#cdom_generating_c_source_code). Generating C source code

Code generation, i.e., turning a statechart model into source code of a programming language, is explained in the section _Generating state machine code_. Therefore we won't go into the details here, but instead only put some emphasis on code generation specialties of Deep C/C++ Integration.



h3(#cdom_creating_a_generator_model). Creating a generator model

In the statechart model introduced above, do the following:

# In the project view, right-click on the project's name. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _New → Code generator model_. The _YAKINDU generator model_ wizard opens.
# Enter a filename into the _File name_ field, e.g., _c.sgen_, and click _Next >_.
# In the _Generator_ drop-down menu, select *YAKINDU SCT C Code Generator*.
# Select the statechart models to generate C source code for. Click _Finish_.

YAKINDU Statechart Tools creates the following generator model in the file _c.sgen_:

bc.. GeneratorModel for yakindu::c {

    statechart statechart {

        feature Outlet {
            targetProject = "Geometry"
            targetFolder = "src-gen"
            libraryTargetFolder = "src"
        }
    }
}
p. YAKINDU Statechart Tools creates the target folders _src_ and _src-gen_ and generates the C source representing the statemachine into them.



h3(#cdom_the_generated_c_code). The generated C code

Particularly interesting are the files _Statechart.h_ and _Statechart.c_.

_Statechart.h_ first includes the _sc_types.h_ header followed by very same C header files that have been included in the statechart:

bc. #include "sc_types.h"
#include "rectangle.h"

The generated code in _Statechart.h_ then uses the native standard and user-defined C data types. For example, the statechart implementation defines the type _StatechartIface_ as follows:

bc. /*! Type definition of the data structure for the StatechartIface interface scope. */
typedef struct
{
    Rectangle a;
    Rectangle b;
    int32_t area_a;
    int32_t area_b;
    Point p;
} StatechartIface;

By including _Statechart.h_ all definitions are available in _Statechart.c_, too. For example, a getter and a setter function for the _Rectangle_ variable _a_ are defined as follows:

bc. Rectangle statechartIface_get_a(const Statechart* handle)
{
    return handle->iface.a;
}
void statechartIface_set_a(Statechart* handle, Rectangle value)
{
    handle->iface.a = value;
}

The external _area_ function is called in the entry actions section of state _Check_:

bc. /* Entry action for state 'Check'. */
static void statechart_enact_main_region_Check(Statechart* handle)
{
    /* Entry action for state 'Check'. */
    handle->iface.area_a = area(handle->iface.a);
    handle->iface.area_b = area(handle->iface.b);
}


h2(#cdom_annotations_short_identifiers). The @ShortCIdentifiers annotation

It is possible to add annotations to a statechart's specification to alter their or the code generator's behavior, see "Statechart Annotations":../user-guide/statechart_language.html#sclang_annotations.

The C/C++ domain offers one more annotation: @ShortCIdentifiers helps you to keep the generated code compliant to rules which require C identifiers not to be longer than 31 characters (or rather, to be uniquely identified by the first 31 characters). To achieve this, instead of aggressively shortening names which are part of a statechart's API, YAKINDU Statechart Tools gives feedback about the names that will be generated and warns if any user input results in C code that is non-compliant with the 31 character rule. This puts the user in charge of the naming scheme and keeps the resulting C identifiers predictable.

This is mainly done by:

# Using only the actual state's name to identify it and forcing you to use individual names for _all_ states
# Checking all names that will be generated by constructs in the statecharts and providing you with feedback if any of them will be longer than 31 characters
# An intelligent name shortening strategy is applied to the static functions in the statechart's source file that keeps a good balance between readability and shortness

Please note that the generator model's option _statemachinePrefix_ is ignored when @ShortCIdentifiers is used.

Keep in mind that all public functions and types of the statechart are prefixed with its name, so keeping that one short helps a lot.

This annotation is not supported by the C++ generator, only by the C generator.

h3(#cdom_annotations_short_identifiers_example). Example

See the following example:

!images/shortidentifiers_errors.png(Unambiguous state names produce errors)!

p=. State names that are not globally unique produce errors.

!images/shortidentifiers_warnings.png(Warnings for elements in the definition section)!

p=. The name of some elements in the definition section produces warnings because resulting identifiers in the source code will be longer than 31 characters.

!images/shortidentifiers_fixed.png(All issues resolved)!

p=. All issues resolved: the states were renamed to be globally unique and some identifiers as well as the statechart's name were shortened to keep everything short.

The state's names need to be globally unique because of a change in the naming scheme of the state enum.

Enum without @ShortCIdentifiers:

bc. /*! Enumeration of all states */ 
typedef enum
{
	House_last_state,
	House_main_region_Idle,
	House_main_region_Automation,
	House_main_region_Automation_heater_Manual,
	House_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto,
	House_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_modes_Normal,
	House_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_modes_Absence,
	House_main_region_Automation_lights_Lights_Off,
	House_main_region_Automation_lights_Lights_On,
	House_main_region_Automation_pond_Pond_Off,
	House_main_region_Automation_pond_Pond_On
} HouseStates;

Enum with @ShortCIdentifiers:

bc. /*! Enumeration of all states */ 
typedef enum
{
	House_last_state,
	House_Idle,
	House_Automation,
	House_Manual,
	House_Auto,
	House_Normal,
	House_Absence,
	House_Lights_Off,
	House_Lights_On,
	House_Pond_Off,
	House_Pond_On
} HouseStates;

Notice how the state's names are not prefixed with their containing regions anymore to save characters.

p. The name shortening algorithm for the static functions works like this, again without @ShortCIdentifiers:

bc. /* prototypes of all internal functions */
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Idle_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_heater_Manual_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_modes_Normal_lr0_lr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_modes_Normal_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_modes_Absence_lr0_lr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_heater_Auto_modes_Absence_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_lights_Lights_Off_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_lights_Lights_On_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_pond_Pond_Off_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean check_main_region_Automation_pond_Pond_On_tr0_tr0(const House* handle);

p. With @@ShortCIdentifiers annotation:

bc. /* prototypes of all internal functions */
static sc_boolean Idle_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Automation_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Manual_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Auto_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Normal_lr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Normal_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Absence_lr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Absence_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Lights_Off_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Lights_On_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Pond_Off_tr0_check(const House* handle);
static sc_boolean Pond_On_tr0_check(const House* handle);


h2(#cdom_currently_supported_primitive_types). Currently supported primitive types

Deep C/C++ Integration natively supports the following primitive C types. That is, in a statechart without any additional data type definitions, the following types are readily available:

* _bool_
* _double_
* _float_
* _int16_t_
* _int32_t_
* _int64_t_
* _int8_t_
* _string_
* _uint16_t_
* _uint32_t_
* _uint64_t_
* _uint8_t_
* _void_




h2(#cdom_current_restrictions). Current restrictions

The current release candidate of YAKINDU Statechart Tools PRO is still missing some C functionalities that will be approached as soon as possible by subsequent releases. Among others, the following issues are known to be not available yet:



h3(#cdom_current_type_range_checks). Type range checks

Type range validations are currently not implemented. As a consequence, it is possible to e.g., assign an _int32_t_ value to an _int8_t_ variable one without any warning.

###. CHECK: Are type range validations still not implemented in the C domain?



h3(#cdom_plain_struct_union_and_enum_types). Plain struct, union, and enum types

In C it is possible to define structs, unions and enums without a _typedef_. They can be referenced by using the corresponding qualifying keyword (_struct_, _union_, or _enum_, respectively). As the statechart language does *not* support these qualifiers, the usage of struct, union and enumeration types is currently restricted to those defined by a _typedef_.

###. CHECK: C domain: Are "struct", "union", and "enum" types still only supported if used in a typedef

h3(#cdom_function_calling_simulation). Evaluation of functions in the simulation

Using the C/C++ domain, it is possible to call functions that are declared in header files. The generated code will do this correctly, but the simulation will not actually evaluate the functions, for multiple reasons:

* Parsing and interpreting C-Code completely and correctly with all possible side effects is very hard and we could never guarantee that YAKINDU Statechart Tools does the right thing in the simulation.
* Even if we could do that, the Compiler can link against one of many possible implementations of the same declaration, and choosing the correct one would be pretty hard, too.

Due to this, we decided not to implement this feature, and doing so is currently not on our roadmap.

However, when using our testing framework SCTUnit, you have the option to mock these functions, and these mocks are then called during testing.

h3(#cdom_constructors). Constructors

Using the C/C++ domain allows you to import classes defined in a C++ header file, and use them as types. This means that you can instantiate objects of these types just like in regular C++ code. However, YAKINDU Statechart Tools currently does not support constructors, so there are certain limitations:

* If the class has a default constructor with no arguments, you can just declare the variable as usual in the statechart: @var o: MyClass@. The constructor of the generated statechart class will then automatically call the default constructor of @MyClass@ to instantiate the object.
* If the class does not have a default constructor, this will fail. In this case, you should declare a pointer instead: @var o: pointer<MyClass>@ - this way, the constructor of the statechart does nothing at all. Instead, you can then assign a proper value to it, ideally _after_ you call the statechart's @init@-function, and _before_ you call the @enter@-function. This ensures correct initialization before the statechart is running.
