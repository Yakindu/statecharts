		<h1 id="installation-guide">Installation Guide</h1>
		<p>In order to start working with YAKINDU Statechart Tools, you have to install the software on your computer. We are assuming you have downloaded the software package and stored it somewhere on your machine.</p>
		<p>The installation process boils down to</p>
		<ol>
			<li>checking the 
				<a href="#system-requirements">system requirements</a>,
			</li>
			<li>unpacking the downloaded ZIP file containing YAKINDU Statechart Tools, and</li>
			<li>executing the 
				<em>SCT</em> application.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is explained in more detail in section 
			<a href="#platform-overview">&quot;Platform overview&quot;</a> and the following sections.
		</p>
		<p>Java developers might want to read section 
			<a href="#jre-not-found">JRE not found</a>, in case they encounter a certain problem.
		</p>
		<h2 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h2>
		<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
		<p>YAKINDU Statechart Tools is based on the Java programming language and requires 
			<strong>Java 7</strong> or higher. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed on your computer.
		</p>
		<p>Installation of Java is beyond the scope of this document. You can find more information on Java and download it for free from Oracle Corporation at 
			<a href="https://www.java.com/">https://www.java.com/</a>. Before downloading Java, make sure you are picking the variant with the correct bit size, i.&nbsp;e. either 32 or 64 bit, whichever is appropriate for your computer.
		</p>
		<h3 id="eclipse">Eclipse</h3>
		<p>Internally, YAKINDU Statechart Tools are based on 
			<strong>
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
			</strong>, an integrated development environment (IDE). YAKINDU Statechart Tools are running inside the Eclipse environment. When you are installing YAKINDU Statechart Tools, a full-fledged Eclipse instance will be put on your computer. Currently (summer 2016) it is the 
			<strong>Mars</strong> release.
		</p>
		<p>If you are new to Eclipse, you might find the 
			<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Help</a> useful, especially the &#8222;Workbench User Guide&#8221;.
		</p>
		<p>If you are an experienced Eclipse user, you can install YAKINDU Statechart Tools into a existing Eclipse instance from an update site.</p>
		<h2 id="platform-overview">Platform overview</h2>
		<p>You can install YAKINDU Statechart Tools as a stand-alone software package under the following operating systems:</p>

		<p>This chapter describes how to install YAKINDU Statechart Tools on a Windows 7 machine.</p>
		<h3 id="unpacking-the-downloaded-file">Unpacking the downloaded file</h3>
		<p>Unpack the software distribution file. Use the file explorer to open the directory you downloaded the software distribution file to, right-click on the latter, and select 
			<em>Extract All...</em> in the context menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img class="standard-image" alt="Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows [1]" title="Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows [1]" border="0" src="images/windows7_install_010_eclipse_extract_1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows &#91;1]</p>
		<p>Choose a directory for YAKINDU Statechart Tools (YAKINDU SCT). The example below assumes you want to install the software in the 
			<em>C:\Program Files\YAKINDU</em> directory.
		</p>
		<p>Depending on your permissions, you might not be able to create a directory and install software under 
			<em>C:\Program Files</em>. In this case, please choose another installation directory at a location you are allowed to write to.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img class="standard-image" alt="Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows [2]" title="Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows [2]" border="0" src="images/windows7_install_020_eclipse_extract_2.png"/>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows &#91;2]</p>
		<p>Click on 
			<em>Extract</em> to start the extraction process. With Window&#8217;s built-in unpacker, this will take surprisingly much time. Alternatively, you can use a 3rd-party unpacker like 
			<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>. Saves you a lot of time!
		</p>
		<p>After unpacking, you will find a folder 
			<em>yakindu-sct</em> in your installation directory, i.Â e. 
			<em>C:\Program Files\YAKINDU\yakindu-sct</em> in our example, as shown in the image below:

		<p>There you are: You have installed YAKINDU Statechart Tools. Now you should start it.</p>
		<h3 id="starting-yakindu-statechart-tools">Starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools</h3>
		<p>Start YAKINDU Statechart Tools by running the 
			<em>SCT.exe</em> executable.
		</p>
		<p>To do so, please double-click (or single-click, depending on your Windows settings) on the 
			<em>YAKINDU</em> symbol shown in the sample screenshot above.
		</p>
		<p>Depending on the Windows settings and your permissions, you might get the following security warning, indicating that you downloaded the application from a potentially unsecure source:</p>
		<p>
			<img class="standard-image" alt="Windows security warning" title="Windows security warning" border="0" src="images/windows7_install_045_security_warning.png"/>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">Windows security warning</p>
		<p>Uncheck the 
			<em>Always ask before opening this file</em> option. Click 
			<em>Run</em> to continue starting the application. Subsequently starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools will not show this security warning again.
		</p>
		<p>While YAKINDU Statechart Tools is starting up, it is showing a splash screen:</p>
		<p>
			<img class="standard-image" alt="YAKINDU Statechart Tools starting up and showing a splash screen" title="YAKINDU Statechart Tools starting up and showing a splash screen" border="0" src="images/windows7_install_050_eclipse_splash.png"/>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">YAKINDU Statechart Tools starting up and showing a splash screen</p>
		<p>The software needs a 
			<em>workspace</em> directory where it stores its so-called projects along with other data. During the first startup, the 
			<em>Workspace Launcher</em> dialog asks you to specify the workspace directory in the 
			<em>Workspace</em> field. Please select a new and empty one.
		</p>
		<p>In the example below, we chose the 
			<em>C:\Users\joedoe\workspace</em> directory as our workspace. We also checked the 
			<em>"Use this as the default and do not ask again"</em> option. This is sensible, because on subsequent startups, YAKINDU Statechart Tools won&#8217;t ask for a workspace directory again. Instead it will always use the one we chose once and forever. (You can still change the workspace later via 
			<em>File â†’ Switch Workspace</em> in the main menu.)

		<p>If the installation was completed successfully, Eclipse needs a restart in order to have the changes take effect. A dialog asks whether you want to restart Eclipse right now or later:</p>

		<h2 id="updating-yakindu-statechart-tools">Updating YAKINDU Statechart Tools</h2>
		<p>To check whether a new YAKINDU Statechart Tools release is available and to install it, please select the 
			<em>Help â†’ Check for Updates</em> menu item.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img class="standard-image" alt="Selecting &quot;Help â†’ Check for Updates&quot; in the main menu" title="Selecting &quot;Help â†’ Check for Updates&quot; in the main menu" border="0" src="images/eclipse_update_010_eclipse_menu_check_for_updates.png"/>

		<p style="text-align: center;">Selecting &#8222;Help â†’ Check for Updates&#8221; in the main menu</p>
		<p>If Eclipse finds any software items to be updated â€“ not just YAKINDU Statechart Tools â€“, it will guide you through the process of updating them. Generally Eclipse has to be restarted afterwards to have any changes take effect.</p>
		<p>You can configure Eclipse as follows to automatically check for updates:</p>
		<p>Select the 
			<em>Window â†’ Preferences</em> menu item. The 
			<em>Preferences</em> dialog opens.
		</p>
		<p>Go to the 
			<em>Install/Update â†’ Automatic Updates</em> section. Here you can configure whether and when Eclipse should check for updates and what to do when it finds any.
		</p>

		<h2 id="jre-not-found">JRE not found</h2>
		<p>If you want to develop Java source code, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) in your workspace.</p>
		<p>Usually Eclipse&#8217;s Java Development Toolkit (JDT), which is bundled with YAKINDU Statechart Tools, automatically finds one or more JREs on your machine. However, under certain circumstances this won&#8217;t work and even the JRE that is used to run Eclipse cannot be found. In this case, you will have to add a JRE definition to your workspace by hand.</p>
		<p>In order to check whether you are affected, proceed as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the main menu, select 
				<em>Window â†’ Preferences</em>. The 
				<em>Preferences</em> window opens.
			</li>
			<li>In the 
				<em>Preferences</em> window, select 
				<em>Java â†’ Installed JREs</em>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If the list of installed JREs is empty, you are affected by the problem and will have to manually add a JRE definition. Click on the 
			<em>Addâ€¦</em> button and follow the 
			<em>Add JRE</em> wizard. The Eclipse documentation explains in more detail how to 
			<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%252Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%252Ftasks%252Ftask-add_new_jre.htm">add a new JRE definition</a> to your workspace.
